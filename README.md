## Description 
This is a foreign language learning tool that quizzes the user on the meaning of words extracted from a news article of the user's choice. The tool consists of the `QuizzGlossary` class that holds the glossary, and the `QuizzWindow` class that holds the graphical user interface. The `QuizzGlossary` class has a `launch_log()` method for launching an error log, a `create_glossary()` for creating an empty glossary, an `extract_words_from_article()` method for extracting words from a news article, an `add_word_to_glossary()` method for adding an extracted word and its translation to the glossary, an `add_words_to_glossary_fast()` method for adding words fast by calling `add_word_to_glossary()` in multiple threads, and a `select_word_from_glossary()` method for selecting words from the glossary for the user to be quizzed on. The `QuizzWindow` class has `launch_entry()`, `launch_radiobutton()`, `launch_label()`, and `launch_button()` for launching widgets for user interaction. If the user inputs the url of a news article of choice and interacts with a button widget, the `create_word_quizz()` method is called to create a Word Quizz. If the user then interacts with a radiobutton widget and a button widget, the `display_word_quizz_question()` method is called to display a word to the user, and the `display_word_quizz_answer()` method is called to display the meaning of the word to the user after a two second delay to give the user time to think of the answer.
